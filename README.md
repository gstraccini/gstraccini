- `@gstraccini bump version <version> <project>`: Bumps the [.NET version](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) in .csproj files. :warning: (in development - maybe not working as expected!)
	- `version`: `[required]` The .NET version
	- `project`: `[optional]` The `.csproj` file to update. Suppressing this parameter will run the command in all `.csproj` in the repository/branch
- `@gstraccini change runner <runner> <workflow> <jobs>`: Changes the [GitHub action runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) in a workflow file (.yml) :warning: (in development - maybe not working as expected!)

- `@gstraccini review`: Enable review for the target pull request. This is useful when the PR submitter wasn't on the watch list before, the webhook was not captured, or some failed scenario occurred.
- `@gstraccini track`: Tracks the specified pull request. Queue a build, raise a **[dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) recreate** comment to resolve conflicts and synchronize merge branches. :warning: (in development - maybe not working as expected!)


Multiple commands can be issued at the same time. Just respect each command pattern (with bot name prefix + command).
